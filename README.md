## Introduction

Problems are organized based on the components in their name. A typical problem will look like:

`abc123_a`

The problem is made up of three components: `abc` `123` and `a`.

`abc` stands for "AtCoder Basic Contest" which is the first of three competitor levels. The other two are `arc` (AtCoder Regular Contest) and `agc` (AtCoder Grand Contest), each more difficult than the previous.

`123` represents the contest number under the contest's respective category. In this case, `123` would mean the 123rd contest to take place.

`a` represents the task within the contest. In general, contests contain between four to seven increasingly difficult problems labeled `a` to `f2`.

Tasks are also grouped based on overall difficulty. For example, task `a` and task `b` may fall within the same difficulty gradient for a given contest despite task `b` being more challenging on average.

The categories in order of difficulty from easiest to hardest are:

* Gray
* Brown
* Green
* Cyan
* Blue
* Yellow
* Orange
* Red
